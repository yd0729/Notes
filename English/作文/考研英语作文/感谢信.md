## 参考译文

尊敬的莎士比亚先生：

我写信是为了表达我衷心的感谢。我指的是那天我被一辆出租车从自行车上撞下来的不幸事件。

要不是您及时帮我进行急救处理的话，恐怕后果会更严重。大家都认为，正是您在那个紧急事件中的机智反应才促成了这样令人满意的结果。

尽管现在越来越多的人谈论到大公无私的必要性，但是我们看到很少有人言行一致。如果有更多人像您一样的话，世界会更加美好。

​ 您真诚的，

​ 李明

## 道长点评

考研写作已经两次考察感谢信，分别是 2010 年英语（二）感谢美国同事的接待和 2016 年英语（二）感谢朋友的祝贺。英语（一）还未考过，要引起重视。感谢信首先应向对方表示诚挚的感谢，其次回忆快乐时光并表达你的感受，最后希望有机会回报对方的好意和帮助。
