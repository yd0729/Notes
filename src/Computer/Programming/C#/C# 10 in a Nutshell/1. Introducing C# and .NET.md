# 1. Introducing C# and .NET

- general-purpose
- type-safe

## object-oriented

- encapsulation: public, private
- inheritance
- polymorphism

distinctive features of C# from an object-oriented perspective:

- unified type system: all types untimately share a common base type.
- Classes and interfaces
- Properties, methods, and events

C# also borrows from the functional programming paradigm:

- Functions can be treated as values: delegates
- C# supports patterns for purity
    - lambda
    - query expressions
    - records

## Type Safety

- static typing
- strongly typed language

## Memory Management

C# relies on the runtime to perform automatic memory management.

C# does not eliminate pointers.

## CLRs, BCLs, and Runtimes
